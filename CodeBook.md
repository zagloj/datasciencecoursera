The raw data is downloaded from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip.

This data set is created with the following steps
- Combine the training set (X_train.txt) with the test set (X_test.txt)
- Filter this data set to only contain data on mean and standard deviation
- Add the subject info from both the training set and the test set
   as a separate column (from subject_train.txt and subject_test.txt)
- Add the y labels (y_train.txt and y_test.txt) which contains the
   activity information.
- Create a summary by average the data by each subject and each activity
